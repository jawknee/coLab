OK - since the door is open now (John has discovered/proven that comments work), this is the one (Beach) I most want feedback on - specifically the non-flute rhythm parts.  (Hey - spell checking is in the browser - who knew? - apparently, not me.)<br>
<br>
With Dan scheduled to come out in about a week - I'm hoping to have some progress on Beach that we can work with - but I need some feedback.<br>
<br>
One thing I want to say - what I noticed most about this is that John's part has a really nice, rolling groove to it.   My additions, mostly, cover that - but every now and then I'd get into the groove.   My plan, such as it is, is to get whatever rhythm parts I add into that groove - make things better - not worse.<br>
<br>
So - nice job John!   Next up - some insightful comments on Beach, rhythm and such.  (And no, I'm not planning a flute cascade - at least not right now... :-) ).<br>
<br>
Note(s): I've reformatted the way comments are emailed - should be more flexible (the reason for all the test emails last night), the pages have all been moved to their new locations, forwarding pages appear to be in place and working and...   these comment emails have links back to the parent page.    That all appears to be working.    So - comment away!
