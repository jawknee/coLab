Hey, I'm back. You're doing great things with this program jk.
Much to comment on, but I should listen again. I like the quick turn from Walk to Cove. Wonder if Intro to Walk could have the pause shortened. I may well have passed my limit on BRT volume, or perhaps duration. Perhaps a little too unsubtle? I now realize that if I'd played Rain in C (instead of E flat) I could sing it readily. I wonder what the results would be changing key to C for rain. Can that be tried using midi output. More later...

Yup - it took!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the comments - yeah, the BRT rain is a bit much - but I'm curious what you think of having it during Storm? Below a certain point, it becomes invisible (which might be good).<br>

C, huh? That might be worth a try - though I don't know that we've used pure MIDI yet - should be able to come up with something. I may give that try - I can try to pitch shift the voice - hopefully with less of a chipmunk effect. Another option might be harmonies...  but we can talk about that - possibly using this tool. <grin><br>

More later!<br>
