	<h1>Time/Locator Tagging</h1>
	<font size=-1><i>October 26, 2014</i></font><br>
	</center>
	The new coLab Time/Location Tagging feature is now working.
	<p>
	Simply enter a time value (must contain at least one ':', e.g, :23) or
	preceed a locator number with a pound-sign (e.g., #1) and the text on the
	web page will be highlighted and will take you directly to that location 
	and start playing,
	<p>
	If you enter a time that is beyond the end of the song, or a locactor button
	that is now set yet, the tags will not be active on the page.
	<p>
	In addition, links appear on the page after submitting the comment as well
	as in the email. 
	<p>

	<h2>Details</h2>
	There's not a lot of detail here, other than what constitues a time
	string.  To match and show up as a tag, a time string must have:
	<p>
	<ul>
		At a minimum:
		<li>A colon and two digits (seconds):  :21
		Optionally:
		<li>a fractional part:  :21.3  (as many digits as you care to type)
		<li>one two digits and colon (minutes):  1:23  23:06
		<li>An hour - in this case, only one digit, a colon and 
		minutes and seconds must both be two digits:   1:05:33.8
	</ul>
	This should tag things that look like time, but not tag things like
	"2:1" which would likely be a ratio.
	<p>
	The locator tags are just a # and one or two digits.

	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	There's not a lot here, but under the hood there are some differences
	between what appears on the page and what shows up on the Comment 
	confirmation page or email.
	<p>
	The values on the page are not really links, but are &gt;span&lt; tags
	that invoke the javascript directly.   They are made active as the
	page loads and are validated at that time.
	<p>
	For the comments page and email, the matching strings are tagged 
	with a URL, which passes a time= or locator= parameter on the end
	of the URL.
