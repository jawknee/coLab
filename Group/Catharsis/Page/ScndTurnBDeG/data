description="""This is my first attempt at automating a large portion of the web page generation.
I'm typing these comments as the other script builds the couple thousand images.
This is the version of Second Turn (current title) that I did for Nola for her birthday plus
tonight's addition: Drums, Bass, and electric guitar.

The latter is particularly weak - but I just wanted to get an idea. Besides - a good part of this
was testing out my partial automation.

Not a lot more to say about it at this point. I'll see about getting comments working soon.
