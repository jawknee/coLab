This is barely more than a place-holder for the Catharsis "home" in this collaboration tool.
<p>
It is currently generated from a simple data file (including these comments) and should soon have, in
addition to the most recent activity, on the left, a list of all relevant projects, related links
(pictures?), etc.
<p>
Comments appear to be working - you can leave them below re: the interface, or on each
of the specific song pages.
<p>
Specific planned enhancements / implementations:
<ul>
	<li>Projects (e.g., JDJ-3, Distant Converstations, etc. )<br>
	Would list associated pieces, related projects.  There could be meta projects (JDJ comprises 
	JDJ-1 through 5).   
	<p>
	<li>Pieces / Songs (e.g., Storm, Rosemary In Bloom)<br>
	The distinction is not that strong lately for us between a project like JDJ-5 
	and a Piece or Song like "It Must Have Been the Rain", but I
	think normally a project would have a number of pcs/sngs.
	<p>
	Pieces can also have related Projects or Pieces (future tense of "can also have")
	<p>
	<li>Need to nail down the internal date format (to show most recent activity)
	<p>
	<li>Need to extend the generating code to go from a flat file system to more of a search/scan system
	<p>
	<li>Implement "What's New", "Archive", "Home" and "Help".
	<p>
	<li>Consider access feature: collaborators can agree on who sees what... (unanimous seems
	reasonable), and eventually generate the pages on the fly so that people see an interface tailored
	to their access. (Would require some form of login / id) - security concerns soon arise.
	<p>
	<li>Reevaluate things...
	<p>
	<li>Consider conversion to PHP and MySQL.
</ul>
