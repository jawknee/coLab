Hey guys - just a heads up...<br>
<br>
Looks like I'll have some time tonight - so I'm hoping to take this to the next level.    I'll try to keep things up and running (and keep stray test emails under control), but I thought I'd note what's up - if only as a reference for me.<br>
<br>
Specifically:<br>

(dammit - somehow submitted the previous comment... )<br>
<br>
Anyway, planned are:<br>
  - rework the generation scripts to the new directory structure<br>
  - finalize the date format (UTC, internally) and reporting format (US/Pacific for now, at least)<br>
  - Comments will update the update time for a song.  This will put older songs with new comments on the update list (btw: it's currently newest at the bottom - I have my reasons.. whatcha think?)<br>
  - add project and maybe related_projects to songs - in preparation for consolidating project and song info (they way I imagine this should be pretty cool)<br>
Longer term I want to see about adding code to process emails - that way one can add to the comments by simply replying to the email..   That one will take a little longer.<br>
<br>
So - let me now what you think.   I think it's nearly as good at the iWeb pages were - once the Archive is in place it basically will be.   With the other plans - it should be much better.

Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.<br>
<br>
No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  <br>
<br>
Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.  <br>
<br>
Onward...
