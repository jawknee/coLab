Text="Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.

No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  

Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.

Text="Thanks for your patience during early development - I suspect things will settle down a bit.  (&#034;Lost&#034; a few comments, but got them back - a couple of times.)

In any case - I&#039;m still looking for feedback on this one - specifically the rhythm parts - I know the rhythm itself is a bit spastic, but I&#039;m more looking for whether this is in the right direction and more generally, how it  sounds.  We can scale the flutes as much as we care to, but if anyone wants to hear this with something left out or quieter, or something else featured - let me know.  

I might have time to do one more round on this before Dan comes out.
