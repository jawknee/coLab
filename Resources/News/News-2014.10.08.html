	<h1>Locator Buttons</h1>
	<font size=-1><i>October 8, 2014</i></font><br>
	Locator Buttons have arrived.   These are current only set "manually"
	on my end - but some day I hope to have a mechanism for any one to add
	a locator.
	<p>
	The buttons show up in place of the old progress bar, which was never really
	needed since the cursor on the page serves that purpose.
	<p>
	Roll over the graphic on the main page and the locators will appear; you 
	can hover over the buttons to see there description and what time the
	correspond to.   Also, there are links on the right side that show the
	description and time. 
	<p>
	Neither of these are available in fullscreen, but there are small 
	matching tags along the top of the graphic showing where the locations are.

	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	The buttons and locator links (and the new tagged time and locator strings)
	are activated by javascript and are not activated if javascript it turned off.
