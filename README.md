coLab
=====
A "learning" project for me, this project
is an attempt at a musical collaboration tool
that uses videos to help visualize the music
in time for references.  It provides multiple
methods for navigating as well as a commenting
(initially, very simple).

For me, this is particularly aimed at improving 
my python skills in a larger project, using 
Eclipse to do the bulk of the development, git
and github, and eventually SQL and PHP.
