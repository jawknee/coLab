Hey guys - just a heads up...<br>
<br>
Looks like I'll have some time tonight - so I'm hoping to take this to the next level.    I'll try to keep things up and running (and keep stray test emails under control), but I thought I'd note what's up - if only as a reference for me.<br>
<br>
Specifically:<br>

(dammit - somehow submitted the previous comment... )<br>
<br>
Anyway, planned are:<br>
  - rework the generation scripts to the new directory structure<br>
  - finalize the date format (UTC, internally) and reporting format (US/Pacific for now, at least)<br>
  - Comments will update the update time for a song.  This will put older songs with new comments on the update list (btw: it's currently newest at the bottom - I have my reasons.. whatcha think?)<br>
  - add project and maybe related_projects to songs - in preparation for consolidating project and song info (they way I imagine this should be pretty cool)<br>
Longer term I want to see about adding code to process emails - that way one can add to the comments by simply replying to the email..   That one will take a little longer.<br>
<br>
So - let me now what you think.   I think it's nearly as good at the iWeb pages were - once the Archive is in place it basically will be.   With the other plans - it should be much better.

Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.<br>
<br>
No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  <br>
<br>
Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.  <br>
<br>
Onward...

Not too much new - mostly internal restructuring to simplify things on
my end - took me about 3 hours to post the first of the three pages from
last night - largely due to code refactoring, but last one: 10-15
minutes.<br>
<br>
Not clear how much time I'll get to work on this in the next two weeks,
but I suspect I'll dig into it after I get back to CA on the 27th.
Projects and Songs are probably at the top of the list. I'd also like to
look into some features like "Ask a question", "Add a survey", and maybe
even some sort of a search (though my hope is that searching will be
less of an issue if the pages are organized well - we'll see).<br>
<br>
Should probably also do something about the email addresses - I added
catharsis@jawknee.com - and that's causing me to get 2, or more -
depending on the number of replies, emails per. Seemed like a good idea
at the time.<br>
<br>
If you think of a feature you'd like - the "What's New" page (linked in
the email) is as good place as any - for now at least. -jk <br>

Hey - just a quick note - I like to run notes through the i/f to see what problems show up.   Last night I got the idea that my python program that generates  the image sequence that later becomes the movie, should be rewritten (the plan all along).  The initial version really would have been better suited as a shell script - it was just calling a bunch of programs to handle the formatting, compositing, etc. of the various bits for each frame.    It occurred to me that there&#039;s probably a Python library for that - sure enough PIL (Python Image Library) has been around since 1995 (Yikes!).  <br>
<br>
The funny thing is, no, instead of reading and writing a bunch of files for each image, it now has everything in memory and does one read for the initial image, and one write for frame.   I figured it&#039;d be 10x faster - it&#039;s maybe 2-3x faster - but - it works &#042;and&#042; I&#039;ve got a lot more flexibility with the time counters.    We&#039;ll see if I get a chance to work up something - but with me flying out on Sunday...   Well...<br>
<br>
onward!

Coming along - got the current projects section working - it&#039;s on the left under Recent Updates.  Also replaced some of the headers with graphics - gives me much more flexibility in the look.<br>
<br>
Going to try to get some music done tonight - we&#039;ll see.
