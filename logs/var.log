Text="Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.

No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  

Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.  

Onward..."
