I wanted to pump out another bit of listening to test out the
improved methods for generating these pages - it's getting better.
<p>
In spite of the appearance - this is mostly the "Nine is Nifty"
Alto Flute track.  That track is the dark-lighted one near the middle.
<p>
Above and below that are the other 24 Alto Flute tracks.  Below that are
the submasters for the Solo Alto Flute (straight volume line) and the
Accomp. Altos and C Flutes (mostly matching jagged lines).  And finally below
that are the 5 C flutes.
<p>
And extra finally: at the top is the piano roll.
<p>
I mostly wanted to experiment with the idea I had of a large number
of flutes, but only in spots.    I played a little loose in the later
A sections, but just to hear what's there.
<p>
I think this has got some potential.  Let me know what you think.
