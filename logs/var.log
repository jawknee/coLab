Text="Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.

No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  

Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.

Text="Thanks for your patience during early development - I suspect things will settle down a bit.  (&#034;Lost&#034; a few comments, but got them back - a couple of times.)

In any case - I&#039;m still looking for feedback on this one - specifically the rhythm parts - I know the rhythm itself is a bit spastic, but I&#039;m more looking for whether this is in the right direction and more generally, how it  sounds.  We can scale the flutes as much as we care to, but if anyone wants to hear this with something left out or quieter, or something else featured - let me know.  

I might have time to do one more round on this before Dan comes out.

Text="Not too much new - mostly internal restructuring to simplify things on my end - took me about 3 hours to post the first of the three pages from last night - largely due to code refactoring, but last one: 10-15 minutes.  

Not clear how much time I&#039;ll get to work on this in the next two weeks, but I suspect I&#039;ll dig into it after I get back to CA on the 27th.   Projects and Songs are probably at the top of the list.  I&#039;d also like to look into some features like &#034;Ask a question&#034;, &#034;Add a survey&#034;, and maybe even some sort of a search (though my hope is that searching will be less of an issue if the pages are organized well - we&#039;ll see).

Should probably also do something about the email addresses - I added catharsis@jawknee.com - and that&#039;s causing me to get 2, or more - depending on the number of replies, emails per.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.

If you think of a feature you&#039;d like - the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034; page (linked in the email) is as good place as any - for now at least.    -jk"

Text="Hey - just a quick note - I like to run notes through the i/f to see what problems show up.   Last night I got the idea that my python program that generates  the image sequence that later becomes the movie, should be rewritten (the plan all along).  The initial version really would have been better suited as a shell script - it was just calling a bunch of programs to handle the formatting, compositing, etc. of the various bits for each frame.    It occurred to me that there&#039;s probably a Python library for that - sure enough PIL (Python Image Library) has been around since 1995 (Yikes!).  

The funny thing is, no, instead of reading and writing a bunch of files for each image, it now has everything in memory and does one read for the initial image, and one write for frame.   I figured it&#039;d be 10x faster - it&#039;s maybe 2-3x faster - but - it works *and* I&#039;ve got a lot more flexibility with the time counters.    We&#039;ll see if I get a chance to work up something - but with me flying out on Sunday...   Well...

onward!"
