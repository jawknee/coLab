Text="Not that I plan daily updates, and not necessarily as &#034;coLab&#034; emails... but it&#039;s fun.  For now.  For me, at least.

No changes to the site - my current work can all be done &#034;locally&#034; on my Mac - now that I have apache running.  But I managed to get the various time handling bits nailed down - including converting the internal time formats from PST to UTC, converting UTC to seconds (for sorting), and creating a Songdata class.  The plan for tonight - depending on beer saturation status - is to &#034;walk&#034; the tree of songs (I like the sound of that), build a list of song data items, sort them by create date for the prev/next links, generated those, then sort by update and use that for the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034;, noting new songs vs. songs with updated comments.  

Then a simple (heh) matter of creating the project pages, song pages, the Archive page and such.   I think I&#039;m about 80-90% done with the underlying infrastructure to get this next phase running - funny how you (I) can spend a couple of hours trying to make sure the whole date/time thing is working - then page generation just falls into place.   Maybe.   OK - all ten target boots are done - time to try again with a different kernel.

Text="Thanks for your patience during early development - I suspect things will settle down a bit.  (&#034;Lost&#034; a few comments, but got them back - a couple of times.)

In any case - I&#039;m still looking for feedback on this one - specifically the rhythm parts - I know the rhythm itself is a bit spastic, but I&#039;m more looking for whether this is in the right direction and more generally, how it  sounds.  We can scale the flutes as much as we care to, but if anyone wants to hear this with something left out or quieter, or something else featured - let me know.  

I might have time to do one more round on this before Dan comes out.

Text="Not too much new - mostly internal restructuring to simplify things on my end - took me about 3 hours to post the first of the three pages from last night - largely due to code refactoring, but last one: 10-15 minutes.  

Not clear how much time I&#039;ll get to work on this in the next two weeks, but I suspect I&#039;ll dig into it after I get back to CA on the 27th.   Projects and Songs are probably at the top of the list.  I&#039;d also like to look into some features like &#034;Ask a question&#034;, &#034;Add a survey&#034;, and maybe even some sort of a search (though my hope is that searching will be less of an issue if the pages are organized well - we&#039;ll see).

Should probably also do something about the email addresses - I added catharsis@jawknee.com - and that&#039;s causing me to get 2, or more - depending on the number of replies, emails per.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.

If you think of a feature you&#039;d like - the &#034;What&#039;s New&#034; page (linked in the email) is as good place as any - for now at least.    -jk"

Text="Hey - just a quick note - I like to run notes through the i/f to see what problems show up.   Last night I got the idea that my python program that generates  the image sequence that later becomes the movie, should be rewritten (the plan all along).  The initial version really would have been better suited as a shell script - it was just calling a bunch of programs to handle the formatting, compositing, etc. of the various bits for each frame.    It occurred to me that there&#039;s probably a Python library for that - sure enough PIL (Python Image Library) has been around since 1995 (Yikes!).  

The funny thing is, no, instead of reading and writing a bunch of files for each image, it now has everything in memory and does one read for the initial image, and one write for frame.   I figured it&#039;d be 10x faster - it&#039;s maybe 2-3x faster - but - it works *and* I&#039;ve got a lot more flexibility with the time counters.    We&#039;ll see if I get a chance to work up something - but with me flying out on Sunday...   Well...

The strings absolutely make this come together.  I have a hard time remembering what it was like before.   I love the change in tone / feel as the song progresses.  You end up in a much different spot than when you began. 

My only small thought is that at 1:25 when the second stronger string voice comes in, it feels just the slightest bit abrupt at the moment of entry for the higher part.  Maybe down just a pinch?  (I wouldn&#039;t be suprised however if I came to love that part the most just as it is.)  

Any additional adds?  Maybe a bass drum pedal to accentuate the start of phrases?  

Or it could be done.  Quite wonderful!

As a lead melody line, this feels pretty good ... and seems to be mostly &#034;cringe free&#034;.  

I know this was a quick experiement, but I&#039;m wondering (after listening to the string magic on cove), if some of the &#034;thickening&#034; and &#034;counterpointe&#034; pieces provided by the other flutes might be done with strings (or other instrument).   

A mixing note, I&#039;m wondering if the ryhthmic background could be a bit louder in the balance?  I&#039;m thinking with a fairly simple and strong flute voice, we could have the rest of the music up louder without losing the melody line.

Text="Are you sure at 1:25?    At 1:21 the &#034;New Secret Ingredient&#034; comes into play - which I can now let on:   is the flute itself.   I made 3 copies and pitch shifted them to simulate harmonics - in an attempt to see if I could make the flute sound like, say, a saxophone.  Not quite - and the first attempt, up 7 semi-tones, was not right. Should have been 19.  So - the three voices are a 5th (7 semi-tones), and octave(12) and a octave an a fifth (19).  The last two would be the second and third harmonics.    But I liked the effect of the added fifth - esp. with the octave above that - so I kept it.   

Does it still sound like it&#039;s still the flute?  I can tweak any or all of the harmonic parts as needed.    A bit hard to see but in the top middle of the piano roll is &#034;New Secret Ingredient&#034; and it points to the 4 spots where it&#039;s most obvious.  

The spot I thought you meant is at 1:55 where the descending string voice comes in - I&#039;ve been struggling with this and may just yank it.  You can just see the notes there.  Dan, btw, on your Air, you should be able to hit the button in the lower right of the player to go full screen - for this one in particular, that&#039;s pretty handy.

Text="Huh, 

Well this is interesting.  FWIW ... I don&#039;t mind the raw unfiltered flute.   

I least like the Notch filter flute.  It tends to emphasize the breaths and in addition seems a bit ... hmmm ... scratchy? .... hollow?   I&#039;m not quite sure. 

The last is probably my favorite for places where we want a really full flute sound.  It sounds a bit more natural to me than the third.   

The wild card here is what the reverb sounds like with each of these.  I could imagine that the addition of reverb might make the last EQ bloom a bit beyond what sounds good (to my ear) here.   

The other question mark might also be what part / octave is being played.  With a C flute playing higher, it might be worth doing the entire exercise over again to see if there are differences in what the &#034;best&#034; approach is. 

Thanks for pulling this sampler together!

Text="Hey - thanks for the comments.   

For me, it&#039;s kinda flipped.  Though the peak filter is my least favorite- it&#039;s features the part I removed with the notch.    

There are two things I like about the notch filter.  For one, the flute tends towards a sign wave which can be very wearing on the ear after a while - it also tends to run away in some situations - like with reverb.  I find the sound less fatiguing with a bit of a mid-range knock down.

The other thing I like is the upper harmonics and ... the breath sound.   Makes is sound less like a whistle or a synthesizer, and more like a real instrument blown by a living, breathing, (wild and raging) human beeean!   (That&#039;s about 40 year old reference - geez.)

BTW: the way I find the frequency range to cut I setup a notch/peak filter - I set it to peak pretty much full range - then I sweep it up and down while the flutes playing until I can find the most annoying spot, then I roll the filter back to a notch.   Thats what #3 is above.

I&#039;ll see about doing something similar with reverb - the middle frequencies will be accentuated by the reverb; high frequencies die out pretty quickly.  That&#039;s where you can get some real build up.




Not sure what to do.  I adore the flute sound on Cove right now - with and without the harmonics.  I suppose to do it right, any sort of EQ would want to track the pitch being played, and adjusting specific harmonics.  "

I listened again today - and I understand Dan&#039;s comments on the notch filter.   In this context it is too much.   I think some version of the notch - I think a reverb test might bear me out on this- is good, but maybe less of it.   But I can see value in using a bit of high cut -  esp up above 3-5k.

Text="OK - I&#039;ll jump in with some thoughts, ideas.   

Overall: I&#039;m liking it more (not that I didn&#039;t, just more now).  I intentionally left more space between some of these.   The &#034;separate movements&#034; feel seems to work.  Plus, I love the sounds of the decaying notes.

Intro:  Obviously needs something.  On the low end, I think just good old bass.    Otherwise, maybe some percussion, but probably sparingly. 

Beach: I think bringing the Churangos down in count and volume for most of the song helps.   I&#039;ve noted on recordings where it is used (see: Paul Simon) one has to listen to hear it.  Probably a little goes a long way.  The aforementioned hi-hat part should help - and I&#039;d like to try tambourine.  I think it definitely needs a bass part.   And I&#039;m thinking...  a somewhat edgy electric guitar.   Someone&#039;s going to have to learn how to play it.   I see a trade off between the guitar (or whatever) and flute.   The flute part does seem to step aside in parts.   I&#039;ve also added EQ to the piano - really helps to bring it out.   I&#039;ve also added a bit of a bright PianoTeq (&#034;K1&#034; iirc, a &#034;real&#034; piano).   

Cove: I think this one of the true high spots in the whole piece.   I&#039;m really liking it.

Storm: Ah, those nasty little BRT&#039;s.  I much prefer how they start and end in this mix.  Almost certainly too loud in the middle.  However, I&#039;ve discovered if they&#039;re mixed too low, for too long, they&#039;re a distraction, folks (I played it for a friend at home) keep wondering what&#039;s that?  Bringing them to the forefront at some point can help answer that.

I did get the idea to revisit my audio generation experiments.  Now that I&#039;ve discovered the Python AIFF/AIFC file format interface, it should be reasonably straightforward.   Specifically - I had this vision (audio?) some years ago:  a million rain drops, with a Gaussian distribution in time, over say, 10 seconds, or a minute (or the length of a song), falling in a circle all about one.  The timing is trivial (simple distance calculations from the rain drop to each ear), the amplitude adjustments for things like ones head, a bit more, and the frequency issues for discerning front / back, even more.  But they can be addressed separately, and in that order.    I think it would sound cool.   And...

It&#039;s a natural for the planned Bevy of Flying Flute Birds.   Basically the same problem.

It may not be obvious, at least at first, but there is a drum track here.  Mostly cymbals and drums (wait, isn&#039;t that mostly what a drum kit is??).  I wanted to do a lightning (cymbals) / thunder (toms, kick drum).   I need to do it better so I can stand to mix it in louder.

Rain: so, as I said above, this was more playing around than anything.  One thing I did like, and it was quite by accident, the three cymbal notes leading into it (you may have to crank it up to hear all three).  This just me trying to see how different hits on the crash sounded after I&#039;d finished my klutzy first take.   Leading into Rain seems to work.   Also - you may have noticed, this starts with the second half of the intro that was cut off from the original intro.  I kinda like the longer lead-in to the vocals.   I also kind of like the rather bizarre, pitch shifted piano sound where it comes in in C.  

While I&#039;m on a roll:   I hope to get some time this weekend to address some structural issues in the tool, specifically adding a data structure to songs.   This will simplify adding other songs - like JDJ-1  through 4.

At some point I&#039;ll want to deal with:   Actual names of songs / pieces (the song data structure will allow that), and i/f details like should the most recently updated song appear first under Current Projects, or should that order stay chronological?   

OK - I&#039;ve strayed far enough from the main theme.   

Onward!"

Text="Dan&#039;s back from NYC and list&#039;nin to music.   I really feel like this is coming together.  

Intro:  This actually feels close.  A few thoughts from the peanut gallery.
1) Hiss on the opening.
2) Near the end of the intro feels like it needs just a bit of &#034;something else&#034;
3) Transition to Beach ... maybe BRT&#039;s (see note on storm) or some other transitional bit. 

Beach:  I was listening mostly to the flute.  I&#039;m surprisingly not tormented by it. Here are a few opportunities for edits:  (I know these sound fuzzy ... but maybe we could collaborate when I&#039;m out in EARLY FEBRUARY).  
 
1) One or two spots the added flute choir could be a bit more sustained ... it leaves too quickly
2) One or two spots the soft underlying flute choir might be dropped out (feels mostly muddy)
3) One or two spots a counterpointe flute part could be made clearer (and perhaps kept to a single flute).  Maybe some of the C flute bits?
4) One or two spots the lead flute might be dropped out and a second instrument comes in to carry the line. 

Cove:  Ahhh
1) Transitions from Beach and to Storm could potentially both use the BRT&#039;s

Storm:  Actually like the King Crimson style percussion bits at several points. 

1) I find the BRT&#039;s to be kind of distracting after the initial stage setting.  Could we maybe use them as a transitional device in several spots rather than an ongoing background on Storm? 

Rain:  Not too fond of the &#034;John with steer like balls&#034; vocal part.  I like it better as a tenor vocal.  Quite liked the beginning instrumental bit.

Text="Very cool.   Some thoughts:

Intro:
1) Hiss - yup - meant to mention this: just haven&#039;t got to it - not worried about being able to fix it (nor forgetting, for that matter).
2) yup - agreed - needs something.  (Looks like I&#039;ll have an English Horn for a couple of months starting Monday - not that that would be it.)  I do have a family of recorders.  :)
3) BRT transition - hmm, that could work.

Beach:
1) Yup - sustaining the flute bits is planned.   I actually shortened them a bit this time.  These are currently in an &#034;all-in&#034; state:  to lengthen them, I&#039;ll need to do some track specific edits on the 5 C flute and ... 29? alto flute tracks.
2) agreed - but the muddiness might work if we do something with 4) - add another instrument.  Maybe a bit lower in volume, but it sounds like it could work as a &#034;pad&#034;. 
3) Yup - there are many flutes to choose from - including two &#034;good&#034; tracks I&#039;ve barely looked at.  
4) Yup - I want to at least try the electric guitar.

Cove:
1) I will definitely give this a try (BRT xstn from Beach) 

Storm:
1) Yeah - BRT&#039;s are distracting.     I&#039;m a little worried that having them come and go would be even more distracting.    Something to play with.

Rain: heh,  Never intended to keep the bowlegged John voice - all I&#039;ve got currently in that key.   

Early February, eh??  Hopefully *not* mid Feb:  Nola will be out Feb 14-17.   Other than that - come on out!!   Any chance John&#039;s coming too??

Text="So let&#039;s see ... I prefer reverb!  (oh that&#039;s not the question.)

So I don&#039;t hear a lot of difference either.  Which may be good.  The EQ you&#039;re using seems to deal with my concern that if  you drop out the &#034;heart&#034; of the flute sound and leave the high bits, you end up with this kind of thin breathy thing.  This doesn&#039;t feel that way (either in the original or the EQ). 

I did notice that the visuals of the sound seem to indicate that the volume is higher in the EQ version.  Anything to that in reality? 

In any case, I&#039;m quite happy with this in Cove.  Might be worth while to check back in on the choice in other bits where there&#039;s other styles / ranges in play. 

(BTW this is one of my favorite micro-bits from Cove ... I could listen to it over and over again ... oh yeah, I did).   "

Text="Yeah, it does appear to louder w/EQ, doesn&#039;t it.   Hmm - must be a gain boost in the chain.   Clearly the EQ is cut only.     (I like this bit to- then again - I can listen to the whole thing over and over....)"

Text="On the BRT&#039;s,  I just got rid of the volume tracking.   Just let the increase I did during &#034;performance&#034; come through.   

The pitch shift was because John was struggling with the high notes in the key of Eb.  I remember working out the he&#039;d take the high notes going down and I double the upgoing phrase and octave below.   Or some such thing.  Yeah - I think we need harmonies - and the two of us for sure (three?).

Text="This is exciting. I like free form drums in storm.  BRTs worked much better for me than before. Lot&#039;s to like here.  More comments later...  I&#039;ve gotta get a sound system that&#039;s better than what I&#039;m listening on right now."
