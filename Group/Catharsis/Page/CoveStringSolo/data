description="""In search of something "new" I could post, I revisited Cove and
started looking for string sounds.   A dozen or so string patches in I 
had several in mind,
perhaps merged together carefully, they might work.  Then I found the Film
Score patch.  (An old favorite, I used it in Squeegie Boy for...
something.)
<p>
I'd muted everthing else just to get a sense of the patch 
and I liked it so I decided to go with just that
as an interesting  demo.   I've got two more versions in the wings that I can
post.
<p>
The top, darklighted part of the graphic is the piano recording - not included
in the audio.  Below that is the piano roll - the darker the "hole" the louder
the note.  At the bottom is the velocity of each note.
<p>
I only made one change to the MIDI recording: I lengthened the final note. It
appears that for some reason, we didn't get a recording of the sustain pedal
on this piece - so I just lengthened the final note to match where, on the
recording, you can hear the dampers drop..  
<p>
This may have turned out to be a good thing - more on that in future drops.
<p>
I've already listened with piano and flute and it works well.  I may have to
rethink my idea of "improving" the string part later in the piece.
