I kinda like it.  A little sloppy now, of course, but I agree it has potential

Oh!  I like me much better than I thought I would!  <br>
<br>
As a lead melody line, this feels pretty good ... and seems to be mostly &#034;cringe free&#034;.  <br>
<br>
I know this was a quick experiement, but I&#039;m wondering (after listening to the string magic on cove), if some of the &#034;thickening&#034; and &#034;counterpointe&#034; pieces provided by the other flutes might be done with strings (or other instrument).   <br>
<br>
A mixing note, I&#039;m wondering if the ryhthmic background could be a bit louder in the balance?  I&#039;m thinking with a fairly simple and strong flute voice, we could have the rest of the music up louder without losing the melody line. <br>

Seems reasonable - I need to get better, tighter churango parts recorded next.  Possibly later today.  (It is interesting how much the finger picked parts sound like a bango.)
