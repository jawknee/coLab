I had to find out if there was a clipping problem with the piano part in 
Storm.   I'm happy to report there is none - as you can see from above, the
piano was recorded with decent headroom at a good level. The earlier clipping
was from the mix of that recording and the PianoTeq "rhodes" being mixed too
hot.   I've dropped it down a bit and generated the above.   
<p>
Interestingly, there is at least one missing note in the MIDI above.  It would
be easy enough to add back in from the context.
