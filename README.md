coLab
=====
coLab is a musical collaboration tool, currently 
built around a visualization the displays screenshot 
or generated audio overviews with a syncronized cursor.

Major features:

* Uses html5 and multiple source files for very comprehensive coverage
  from hi-end monitors to tablets and phones - commercial (mp4) and
  open source (webm) content

* Tool requires nothing more than an audio file and some descriptive
  text.   And optional "screenshot" can be added (from ProTools, Logic,
  etc.) with a simple setting of the start and end points.

* Multiple pages and formats can be generated in the background while
  creating / editing additional pages

* Planned ftp engine (currently leverages Interarchy on the mac0)

A "learning" project for me, this project
is an attempt at a musical collaboration tool
that uses videos to help visualize the music
in time for references.  It provides multiple
methods for navigating as well as a commenting
(initially, very simple).

For me, this is particularly aimed at improving 
my python skills in a larger project, using 
Eclipse to do the bulk of the development, git
and github, and eventually SQL and PHP.
