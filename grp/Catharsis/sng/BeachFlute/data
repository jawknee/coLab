<i>(I know, not again - but this was fun!)</i>
<p>
In prepping for a new assembly test, 
I decided to do a one-pass flute prune.  Still a bit 
busy in spots, but ducking a few outliers - which you can 
now track as you watch - made a vast improvement on the 
flute-palatability. 
<p>
That reminds me - I need to look into a spell checker for the
online text entry...
<p>
Shown are the five flute tracks and their respective volumes below each.
It's a flute-for-all, no doubt - I added just enough piano to give some context.
In the complete mix I notched the flute mix at usual 1k - really seems to help.
removing the sharpness but leaving the deep and high end largely alone.  Then 
I realized it was easy enough to just dump it again and the flutes sound much 
better (a bit shrill in spots w/o the EQ).
<p>
I'm likely to have a new full test assembly tomorrow night.
