description="""This little tool is getting close to useful.   Here is Beach with
        the piano doubled on a rhodes, and a few other rhythmical friends.  Also,
        all five flutes are on board,   Pretty much to show what we've got, 
        get a sense of what we can do, and...
        <p>
        a chance to see if this new tool can line up nicely with screen detail.
        <p>        It appears that I've got comments working as well - have at it.   (The 
        backend is it still just debug, It will later route back to the page.)
        <p>
        Unseen is that large sections, like the left side bar and the back and forward links,
        are including files that are easily contructed as needed.  So, it's coming along.
