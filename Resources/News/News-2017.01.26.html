	<h1>Click! Improvements</h1>
	<font size=-1><i>January 26, 2017</i></font><br>
	</center>
	The click feature is now working in a more consistent and, I hope, more 
	intuitive way.
	<p>
	The basic behavior is this:
	<ul>
	  <li>Intial click &rarr; play from the beginning
	  <li>Single click while playing &rarr; move to that location, continue playing
	  <li>Click and hold (&gt;1/2 second) &rarr; pause at current play location of initial click
	  <li>Double click while playing &rarr; pause at click location
	  <li>Click while paused &rarr; continue from paused location
	</ul>
	<p>
	In general, the changes are that when paused, a click will continue from the paused
	location, rather than jumping to the mouse location - particularly helpful when 
	following links in email messages and such.  Click-and-hold (for 1/2 second) will
	pause at the current play location when the mouse is first clicked 
	(1/2 second before it stops, due to the delay).  A double-click when playing 
	will pause at the location of the click.
	<p>
	Hopefully this will make the use a bit easier.  In addition, you can use 
	"space" to toggle Play/Pause and the number keys 1-9,0 for locators 1-10.
