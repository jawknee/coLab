description="""Here's the previous "string" version of Cove, with only 
	the piano mics added.   The flute is just
	audible, sometimes more than just,  but I actually like it in spots.   
	We can add in more or less of the direct flute, but 
	this is the minimal flute we can do and use the piano tracks.  (Yes, I know the strings
	are too loud - fun for now - and helps with seeing how it will interact with the piano.)
	<p>
	That said, I think there are some nice possibilities here.  There are a couple of spots with
	some potential pitch issues.   These could be fixed with pitch shifting, but it would be
	audible with the "distant" flute on a slightly different pitch.   The key may be to go a
	tiny bit crazy and (if it works) go to 4 or 5 slightly pitch / time shifted versions of
	the same flute part as a chorus effect.  I'll play with that later.
	<p>
	As before the top is the piano audio track, below that the piano roll w/velocity spikes,
	and below that the flute track, not included here.
	<p>
	This gives us an idea of some of what we can do with this.
