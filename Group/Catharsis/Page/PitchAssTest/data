Pretty straight-forward, the pitch shifted "rain" (shifted down a minor third
from E&#9837 to C) edited into the last section of Storm.   I also dropped the 
BRT down about 4db.   
<p>
One thing about Storm that I've noticed: the graphic shows some obvious clipping.
It could be in the original recording, or the output of the mix - I'll check this soon.
<p>
The line along the bottom is the BRT volume tracking.
