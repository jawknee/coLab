About time for a new assembly...
<p>
From the upper left to the lower right, there are:
<ul>
 <li>Intro<br>
 new EQ
 <li>Walk on the Beach<br>
 Pruned flutes reunited with the rest
 <li>Secluded Cove<br>
 Strings, Piano, <i>and</i> Flute
 <li>Storm<br>
 Only difference: louder <u>Brazilian Rain Thingies</u>.
 I figure I'll keep raising the BRT volume until someone 
 cries uncle.
 <li>Brazilian Rain Thingies</li>
 Four overlapping tracks: non-performance art.
 <li>It Must Have Been the Rain<br>
 Not much different.  
</ul>

This represents the accumlulation of the last week or so 
of editing - plus the web site work.   This is also the end of 
the line for this particular set of pages.   A new version 
should be out soon with a more sophisticated and flexible 
layout that should lend itself well to expandability, 
etc.   These pages will be retained, in the same basic order,
just at a different web address.
<p>
If in doubt, bookmark:

I suspect it'll be around for a bit...
