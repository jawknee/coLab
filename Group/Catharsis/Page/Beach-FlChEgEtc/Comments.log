Hey, I'm back.  You're doing great things with this program jk.<br>
Much to comment on, but I should listen again.  I like the quick turn from Walk to Cove. Wonder if Intro to Walk could have the pause shortened.  I may well have passed my limit on BRT volume, or perhaps duration.  Perhaps a little too unsubtle?  I now realize that if I'd played Rain in C (instead of E flat) I could sing it readily.  I wonder what the results would be changing key to C for rain.  Can that be tried using midi output.  More later...

Yup - it took!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the comments - yeah, the BRT rain is a bit much - but I'm curious what you think of having it during Storm?  Below a certain point, it becomes invisible (which might be good).<br>
<br>
C, huh?  That might be worth a try - though I don't know that we've used pure MIDI yet - should be able to come up with something.   I may give that  try - I can try to pitch shift the voice - hopefully with less of a chipmunk effect.  Another option might be harmonies... but we can talk about that - possibly using this tool. &#060;grin&#062;<br>

More later!<br>

Thanks for your patience during early development - I suspect things will settle down a
bit. ("Lost" a few comments, but got them back - a couple of times.)<br>
<br>
In any case - I'm still looking for feedback on this one - specifically the rhythm parts -
I know the rhythm itself is a bit spastic, but I'm more looking for whether this is in the
right direction and more generally, how it sounds. We can scale the flutes as much as we
care to, but if anyone wants to hear this with something left out or quieter, or something
else featured - let me know. <br>
<br>
I might have time to do one more round on this before Dan comes out. <br>
