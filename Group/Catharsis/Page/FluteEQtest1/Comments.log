Huh, <br>
<br>
Well this is interesting.  FWIW ... I don&#039;t mind the raw unfiltered flute.   <br>
<br>
I least like the Notch filter flute.  It tends to emphasize the breaths and in addition seems a bit ... hmmm ... scratchy? .... hollow?   I&#039;m not quite sure. <br>
<br>
The last is probably my favorite for places where we want a really full flute sound.  It sounds a bit more natural to me than the third.   <br>
<br>
The wild card here is what the reverb sounds like with each of these.  I could imagine that the addition of reverb might make the last EQ bloom a bit beyond what sounds good (to my ear) here.   <br>
<br>
The other question mark might also be what part / octave is being played.  With a C flute playing higher, it might be worth doing the entire exercise over again to see if there are differences in what the &#034;best&#034; approach is. <br>
<br>
Thanks for pulling this sampler together!<br>

Hey - thanks for the comments.   <br>
<br>
For me, it&#039;s kinda flipped.  Though the peak filter is my least favorite- it&#039;s features the part I removed with the notch.    <br>
<br>
There are two things I like about the notch filter.  For one, the flute tends towards a sign wave which can be very wearing on the ear after a while - it also tends to run away in some situations - like with reverb.  I find the sound less fatiguing with a bit of a mid-range knock down.<br>
<br>
The other thing I like is the upper harmonics and ... the breath sound.   Makes is sound less like a whistle or a synthesizer, and more like a real instrument blown by a living, breathing, (wild and raging) human beeean!   (That&#039;s about 40 year old reference - geez.)<br>
<br>
BTW: the way I find the frequency range to cut I setup a notch/peak filter - I set it to peak pretty much full range - then I sweep it up and down while the flutes playing until I can find the most annoying spot, then I roll the filter back to a notch.   Thats what #3 is above.<br>
<br>
I&#039;ll see about doing something similar with reverb - the middle frequencies will be accentuated by the reverb; high frequencies die out pretty quickly.  That&#039;s where you can get some real build up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not sure what to do.  I adore the flute sound on Cove right now - with and without the harmonics.  I suppose to do it right, any sort of EQ would want to track the pitch being played, and adjusting specific harmonics.

Boy, seems hard to tell without listening to it in context of the rest and with the reverb.<br>

I would argue that that&#039;s what the latest Cove II(e) is..  the flute with EQ and reverb and in context.<br>
<br>
I listened again today - and I understand Dan&#039;s comments on the notch filter.   In this context it is too much.   I think some version of the notch - I think a reverb test might bear me out on this- is good, but maybe less of it.   But I can see value in using a bit of high cut -  esp up above 3-5k.    I&#039;ll so some more experiments and let ya know...
