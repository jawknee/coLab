Here's the flute test Dan requested. Well, mostly.  Dan, I know you said this morning 
that you were mostly interested in the sound from Cove, but there's a fair bit of piano
in that track, so I took this snippet from the Nine-is-Nifty track from last night.
<p>
As noted, the first bit is unaffected.  The second has a notch filter at 855 Hz.  I find I
typically notch the C flute around 1000Hz, I did this one by ear, and 855 Hz seemed right.
Mathematically, it looks like 750Hz would be appropriate, but this is at least close.
<p>
The third bit is the same filter in peak mode - accentuating the frequencies that were
removed in the second bit, and the fourth part, is the low pass filter you asked for, in
this case, about 2kHz (I started with 3kHz, but it didn't seem different enough).
<p>
All tracks have been normalized to compensate for the volume differences that would
otherwise be there from the EQ.
<p>
I know you'd said you wanted reverb, but I thought that might actually cover up some of the
differences - easy enough to add later.
<p>
Certainly interested in what you think.
