I hadn't posted anything in a while, so I thought to look 
into John's suggestion about trying IMHBtRain in the key of C.
My memory was that it was (and is, er, was actually) in Eb, but
I pulled out my trusty C-128 and sure enough - it's in Eb.
<p>
Transposing the notes was trivial - actually, the same with the
piano and vocals.  I was surprised how really bad the pitch shifted
piano sounds - it fades out pretty quickly - then back in at the end, 
and defers to the PianoTeq.  This is a K-1 (Kawai?) solo recording, dry
but it doesn't sound right to me - too tired to dig into it further. 
(I've still got an upgrade to version 4 I've paid for and not installed yet.)
<p>
I'm similarly surprised how good the voices sound.   Kinda fun too.
<p>
So John:  good key?
<p>
The content generation is still pretty manual, but not too bad.  The 977
PNG images were built faster than I could type this description.
<p>
<i>Anyway,</i> let me know what you think.

(Note: I didn't quite get the cropping right so the scroll bar doesn't 
match up well - looks to be a bit behind most of the way)
